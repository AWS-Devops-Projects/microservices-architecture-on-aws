# Microservices Architecture on AWS

This is the working github repository for the [**"Learning Live with AWS & HashiCorp"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAH3CkWrNmo) series. We'll discuss the foundations of a microservices architecture, the problem space it solves, where service mesh fits into all of this, and then begin from scratch - setting up a Terraform project, creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and explaining all of the concepts along the way.


This repo will be updated after each episode!

This repo is split into branches, each representing a part in the series:

- Part 1 - Setting up the Terraform project and creating a VPC
